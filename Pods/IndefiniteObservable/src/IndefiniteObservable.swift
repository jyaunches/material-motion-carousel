/**
 An IndefiniteObservable represents a sequence of values that may be observed.

 IndefiniteObservable is meant for use with streams of values that have no concept of completion.

 This is an implementation of a subset of the Observable interface defined at http://reactivex.io/

 Simple synchronous stream:

     let observable = IndefiniteObservable<Int> { observer in
       observer.next(5)
       return noopDisconnect
     }

     let subscription = observable.subscribe { value in
       print(value)
     }

     subscription.unsubscribe()

 Example of an asynchronous stream:

     let observable = IndefiniteObservable<Int> { observer in
       let someToken = registerSomeCallback { callbackValue in
         observer.next(callbackValue)
       }

       return {
         unregisterCallback(someToken)
       }
     }
 */
open class IndefiniteObservable<O: Observer> {
  public typealias Connect<O> = (O) -> Disconnect

  /** Connect is only invoked when subscribe is invoked. */
  public init(_ connect: @escaping Connect<O>) {
    self.connect = connect
  }

  /**
   Subscribes to the IndefiniteObservable.

   The returned subscription will hold a strong reference to the IndefiniteObservable chain. The
   reference can be released by calling unsubscribe on the returned subscription. The Subscription
   is type-erased, making it possible to keep a collection of Subscription objects for as long as
   you need theÂ associated streams alive.

   - Parameter next: A block that will be executed when new values are sent from upstream.
   - Returns: A subscription.

  public final func subscribe(observer: O) -> Subscription {
    return Subscription(connect(observer))
  }
