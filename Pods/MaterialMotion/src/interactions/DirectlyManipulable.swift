/**
 Allows a view to be directly manipulated with a combination of drag, rotation, and scale gestures.

 Composed of three primary sub-interactions: Draggable, Rotatable, and Scalable.

 If the sub-interaction gesture recognizers do not have an associated delegate, then this
 interaction will become the delegate and allow the gestures to recognize simultaneously
 uncoditionally.

 When other gesture recognizers are in play, it is recommended that you make use of the
 `.withExistingRecognizer` configuration option. Provide a gesture recognizer that already has a
 delegate associated with it and the relevant delegate methods implemented to support simultaneous
 recognition that doesn't conflict with the other gesture recognizers.
